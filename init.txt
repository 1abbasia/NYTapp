NY Times Top Storeis renderer app.

Must have:
  -A list article
  -Detailed View of eah article
  -List of articles is clickable and link takes you to the detailed article view 


HIgh level:

1. Create React app, dont think you will need express yet?
2. create a hompage component that that makes an API call to Top Stories API

3. Will need to use axios to make the call
    HomePage.js Component:
        -use useState to control state of page, const [articles,setArticles] = useStae([])
        -use axios to make GET request to API, then the response you will set using setArtciles()
        -This component will return a div that can then have an articles.map() function that spits ou each article in its own div

4. Create a detailedPage component that takes in the article object as prop and renders full article detail on page. Use ReactRouter? to     handle navigation between
    ArticlePage.js component:
      takes in props (article object), returns title, byline, abstract, and article body

5. The sort functionality: Can use react state to keep track of user inputs, or use Lodash?
